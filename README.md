# Graph Search Visualizer

A simple graph search visualizer. I have been learning about Data structures and algorithms and I just wanted to see how the algorithm like DFS, BFS, A\* etc might work on projects such as react since react has it's own philosophy of how to update the DOM.

Currently, the project only have DFS but I might add more search algorithms in the future.
